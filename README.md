# School District Analysis

## Overview

In this project, we will be analyzing a School District for Maria. Our goal is to get a complete data set for all the schools contained within this district for the School Board, including average grades, the percentage of students passing in each category and overall, and the spending summary for each school.

## Results

Let's take a look at the district summary.

And here is the school summary for the 15 schools.

An issue was brought to attention by the School Board, notifying us that Thomas High Schools' ninth graders may have illegitimate grades, so let's see what happened when we change the dataset to remove those specific datapoints.

As we can see in the data, the change in Thomas High School is extremely drastic, and affects the schools overall performance.

The spending of the school seems to remain relatively the same, however. Let's take a look at each schools spending now.

## Summary

Since there was a major issue in the dataset, let's go over some points with Thomas High School:

 - Thomas High-School may have had altered grades for ninth graders. 
 - When this data was removed, the schools overall performance increased drastically.
 - The math scores made the schools performance skyrocket in the cateogry.
 - Likewise, the reading scores made the schools performance improve dramatically.
